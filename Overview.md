*Add a Tag to any commit, in any system**. *Sensible defaults included.*

For clarity, "any system" will always be a work in progress (more tools appear every week it seems!). So far, verified systems include the following:

* GitHub
* GHE Server
* GitLab Cloud
* BitBucket Cloud

## Universal Git Tags

This will add an annotated Tag to a commit and push it to the specified remote.

## Features

* ✔ Tag specific commit
* ✔ Sensible defaults ("specific commit" defaults to current commit, for example)
* ✔ Force Push (defaults to false)
   * Enables a "Docker latest" style of tagging. For example, you may have one long-lived tag name "Live" that you point towards different commits.
* ✔ Cross platform
   * Can run on updated build agents.
* ✔ Repository agnostic. 
   * Repository can be in GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc!

## Motivation

While other tasks exist for tagging, they did not satisfy our needs. See our longer explanation in the [source repo](https://github.com/cloudpups/universal-git-tags#motivation) for more detail.
