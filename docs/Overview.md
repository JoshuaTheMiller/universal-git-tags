For clarity, the "any system" goal will *always* be a work in progress. More tools seem to appear every week!

### Current Verified Systems

* [GitHub (cloud)][build]
* [BitBucket (cloud)][build]
* [GitLab (cloud)][build]
* [Azure DevOps Services][build]

> Hi! üëãüèª If you want to see a new service be verified/supported, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudpups/universal-git-tags/issues) (*please check if one already exists for your tool!*) describing what you want verified/supported. Including links to documentation around how access can be accomplished via the CLI, and better yet, detailed steps, will help the request go through quicker.

*Check out the sample build script that demonstrates some verified systems in action: [sample build definition link](https://github.com/cloudpups/universal-git-tags/blob/main/pipelines/example-pipeline.yml)*

## Universal Git Tags

Usage of this Task adds an annotated Tag to a commit and pushes it to the specified remote.

## Features

* ‚úî Tag specific commit
* ‚úî Sensible defaults ("specific commit" defaults to current commit, for example)
* ‚úî Force Push (defaults to false)
   * Enables a "Docker latest" style of tagging. For example, you may have one long-lived tag name "Live" that you point towards different commits.
* ‚úî Cross platform
   * Can run on updated build agents.
* ‚úî Repository Host agnostic. 
   * Repository can be in GitHub, Azure DevOps, BitBucket, and more!

## Supplying Credentials

Different systems have different requirements around how a Personal Access Token must be supplied in the extra headers. For more details on to set up the associated Service Credentials for the various [Verified Systems](#current-verified-systems), please check out the [VerifiedSystems](https://github.com/cloudpups/universal-git-tags/blob/main/docs/VerifiedSystems.md) document.

## Motivation

While other tasks exist for tagging, they did not satisfy our needs. See our longer explanation in the [source repo](https://github.com/cloudpups/universal-git-tags#motivation) for more detail.
